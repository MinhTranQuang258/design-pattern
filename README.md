# Design Pattern
## Observer
### What problems can the _Observer design pattern_ solve?

The _Observer_ pattern addresses the following problems:
+ A one-to-many dependency between objects should be defined without making the objects tightly coupled.
+ It should be ensured that when one object changes state, dependent objects are updated automatically.
+ It should be possible that one object can notify to other dependent objects
